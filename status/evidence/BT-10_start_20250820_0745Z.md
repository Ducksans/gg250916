# BT-10 Start Evidence
UTC_TS: 2025-08-20T07:45:41Z
RUN_ID: 72H_20250820_0745Z
Scope: TASK
Decision: Start BT-10; define minimal path and skeleton for meeting capture, annotation, and recording.
Next: Create skeleton dirs and placeholders for capture/annotation/recording; wire minimal buttons and endpoints.
Context: .rules v3.0 applied and ports fixed (backend:8000, bridge:3037).
Bridge: bridge/server.js serves /ui static, /api/save, /api/open, /api/health.
UI: base snapshot at ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/index.html with overlays via ui/overlays/active.css/js.
Evidence policy: write under status/evidence/* and append-only checkpoints.
SAFE/NORMAL: UI_STABLE gate ensured; evidence writes unchanged between modes.
Prepared to proceed with ST-1001 scaffold and parity checks.
