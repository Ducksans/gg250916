# UI Unified v0 — Render Stability PASS (A1–A4, Dark 4 + Light 1)

Evidence rollup confirming stable render of the Unified UI v0 minimal snapshots (tabs-only, no APIs).  
Scope covers dark theme (A1–A4) and light theme (A1) with hash-based tab navigation.

## Session Meta

- SESSION_ID: GG-SESS-20250816-2249
- CAPTURE_DATE: 20250816
- SNAPSHOT VERSION: v0
- SCREENSHOTS DIR: `gumgang_meeting/ui/logs/ui_unified_20250816_v0_GG-SESS-20250816-2249/screenshots/`

## PASS Criteria

- No raw CSS/JS printed in the document body (no style/script leakage)
- Hash-based tabs switch correctly: `#a1`, `#a2`, `#a3`, `#a4`
- Visual layout is intact and consistent
- Coverage includes:
  - Dark: A1, A2, A3, A4
  - Light: A1

Result: PASS (all criteria met)

## Source Files Used (Minimal, Safe)

- Dark (safe baseline)
  - `gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/v0_safe.html`
  - `gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/index_clean.html` (temporarily aligned to v0_safe.html for stability)
  - `gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/index_clean_safe.html` (copy of v0_safe.html for cross-check)

- Light (safe baseline)
  - `gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/v0_light.html` (freshly rebuilt; head/title/style well-formed)

- Quarantine (for traceability)
  - `gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/index_clean_broken_20250817.html` (kept as-is for forensic review; do not load)

## Repro Instructions (Local)

- Dark: open `v0_safe.html` (or `index_clean.html`)
  - Example: `file:///home/duksan/바탕화면/gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/v0_safe.html#a1`
  - Verify tabs A1–A4 via hash (`#a1`, `#a2`, `#a3`, `#a4`)

- Light: open `v0_light.html`
  - Example: `file:///home/duksan/바탕화면/gumgang_meeting/ui/snapshots/unified_A1-A4_v0/v0_light.html#a1`
  - Verify A1 shows correctly; tabs also switch as expected

- DevTools sanity check
  - Elements tree under `<head>` contains only: `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<style>`; then `</head>` followed by `<body>`
  - No stray `</head>` / `</title>` inside `<style>`
  - No visible raw CSS/JS text in `<body>`

## Issue + Resolution Notes

- Symptom observed earlier: raw CSS/JS text displayed in body; tabs/blocks pushed below text.
- Root cause: malformed HTML — stray closing tags (e.g., `</head>`, `</title>`) leaked into `<style>` or adjacent nodes, causing the parser to treat styles/scripts as text.
- Mitigation:
  - Restored stability by aligning `index_clean.html` with `v0_safe.html` (strict minimal structure).
  - Rebuilt `v0_light.html` from scratch with the same strict structure (light palette only).
  - Isolated the corrupted file as `index_clean_broken_20250817.html` to prevent accidental reloads and for later forensic review.

## Notes on Scope

- This PASS is limited to “render stability” of the minimal snapshots (tabs + layout).  
- Feature-level shortcuts (1–4, Ctrl+←/→, T, ?, Esc), theme toggles, and session meta rendering are intentionally excluded from this PASS scope and will be validated in a separate “Full Minimal” build and evidence set.

## Next Steps

1. Promote stable minimal as the default view for quick visual checks (optional rename to `index.html` after stakeholder confirmation).
2. Prepare and validate “Full Minimal” page (working name: `index_full.html`) that includes:
   - Tabs (hash)
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Theme toggle (dark/light)
   - Session meta (query-based) and copy-to-clipboard
3. Collect second evidence set for the feature PASS (A1–A4 + dark/light + shortcuts).
4. Append memory checkpoint with evidence links for continuity.

## Sign-off

- Verifier: Duksan  
- Witness: Local Gumgang  
- Decision: “UI Unified v0 Render Stability — PASS (A1–A4 Dark + A1 Light)”
