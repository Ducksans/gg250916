# ü™∑ Fetch Probe Report ‚Äî Basic Metrics and Notes (v0.1)

Purpose
- Record the outcome of recent HTTP fetch probes with minimal, truthful metrics and observations.
- Establish a standard format for future integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256, byte length).

Session Context
- Environment: Zed-local Gumgang
- Scope: Capability verification (network text retrieval)
- Policy: Evidence-first, append-only logging elsewhere (see memory/memory.log)

---

## Probe 1 ‚Äî https://example.com

- Status: SUCCESS
- Content type: text/html (implied)
- Title observed: ‚ÄúExample Domain‚Äù
- Byte length: N/A (not measured in this run)
- Encoding: N/A (not captured)
- Checksums: N/A (not computed)
- Notes:
  - Canonical lightweight page for fetch verification.
  - Suitable for latency/sanity checks.

---

## Probe 2 ‚Äî https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt

- Status: SUCCESS
- Content type: text/plain (RFC text)
- Title observed: ‚ÄúThe JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format‚Äù (RFC 8259)
- Byte length: N/A (not measured in this run)
- Encoding: UTF-8 (typical for RFC text; not programmatically confirmed here)
- Checksums: N/A (not computed)
- Notes:
  - Serves as a stable, standards-track reference payload.
  - Useful for downstream JSON-related validation exercises.

---

## Aggregate

- Total probes: 2
- Success: 2
- Failure: 0

---

## Limitations in This Report

- No byte-length measurement performed.
- No SHA-256 or other checksum computed.
- No response header archive captured in this file.

(Reason: Kept to a minimal ‚Äúbasic metrics‚Äù record. Integrity extensions can be run as a follow-up.)

---

## Next Steps (upon approval)

1) Capture headers and byte lengths
   - Store basic response headers (Content-Type, Content-Length if present).
   - Record measured byte length of body.

2) Compute checksums
   - SHA-256 (preferred) and record alongside byte length.
   - Save to `status/tools_probe/fetch_probe_checksums.md`.

3) Link evidence
   - Append memory reference line numbers to `memory/memory.log` PROBE entries.
   - Cross-link from this file to checksum ledger and vice versa.

4) Regression routine
   - Re-fetch at intervals or via a ‚ÄúCHECKPOINT NOW‚Äù trigger.
   - Compare current checksums/lengths to prior; note any drift.

Append-only Note
- Treat this file as a human-readable record of specific probe outcomes.
- For integrity-critical logs, use append-only memory and dedicated checksum ledgers.
