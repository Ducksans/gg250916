# Gumgang Tools Probe — Sandbox Cycle (v0.1)
# Path: gumgang_meeting/status/tools_probe/sandbox/cycle.txt
# Purpose: Validate the safe create → modify → (planned) delete sequence in a non-SSOT sandbox.
# Policy: SSOT (/gumgang_meeting/docs) remains frozen; sandbox is for capability probes only.
# Guidance: Do not rewrite prior sections; append-only when modifying.

================================================================================
SECTION 1 — CREATION
STATUS: CREATED
ACTOR: Local Gumgang
EVIDENCE:
- This file exists at the sandbox path.
- Creation demonstrates write-permission within project scope (non-SSOT).

NOTES:
- The sandbox is isolated from SSOT and core logs.
- All destructive actions require an explicit Approve signal.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 — MODIFICATION
STATUS: MODIFIED (Cycle-A)
ACTOR: Local Gumgang
WHAT CHANGED:
- Added this SECTION 2 to confirm in-place edit capability.
- Reaffirmed append-only discipline for probe records.

INTEGRITY HINTS (optional, for later verification):
- To compute a checksum after saving (outside this file):
  - sha256(file) → record alongside size(bytes) in a probe ledger.
- Keep evidence minimal and reproducible.

================================================================================
SECTION 3 — DELETE PLAN (Prepared, Not Executed)
PLAN_ID: DEL-PLAN-001
PRECONDITIONS:
- Approver: Duksan
- Trigger: “Approve DEL-1” in session

ACTIONS ON APPROVAL (to be executed by Local Gumgang):
1) Record a tombstone in memory/memory.log:
   - ENTRY: PROBE_DELETE | path: status/tools_probe/sandbox/cycle.txt | reason: sandbox cleanup
2) Remove file:
   - rm gumgang_meeting/status/tools_probe/sandbox/cycle.txt
3) Append a short note to status/tools_probe/probe_test.txt indicating deletion was performed (append-only).
4) (Optional) Create a retention log entry under archive_docs/retention_logs with timestamp, reason, and approver.

ROLLBACK PLAN:
- If deletion was unintended, recreate this file with a new SECTION stating “RESTORED” and reference the retention log.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 — CURRENT SNAPSHOT
PROBE_ID: TPS-001
CYCLE_STATE: Ready for deletion upon approval (DEL-1)
SAFETY: SSOT unaffected; sandbox only
NEXT STEP: Await Approve DEL-1 or further modification instructions

# End of sandbox cycle file.
