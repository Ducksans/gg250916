# Status Log (rolling)

Template (append at top):
```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (TZ)
- What I did:
- Why:
- Next:
- Risks/Blocks:
```

## 2025-09-19 01:05 KST
- What I did: Fixed Tailwind dev breakage (CSS brace error), restored layout; reduced hero/card density; wrote README.
- Why: Ensure stable styles and better information density on 1920×1080.
- Next: Polish header/tabs/search, card grid at 4→3→2 columns, add Storybook later if needed.
- Risks/Blocks: None now; watch out for accidental CSS syntax errors.
